# Flagpoles

*A project aimed at making editing the venerable L4D1/2 flagpole prop easier.*

This project can be used to edit the flagpole, as it includes both an *uncompiled .QC/.SMD* set, and a *.PSD file* for making new flag diffuse maps.

Please note, the flagpole materials as delivered make use of the **Layer Styles feature of Photoshop**. If you are using GIMP or Paint.NET, please take note of this, and make workflow adjustments as-needed.
